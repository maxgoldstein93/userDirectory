## User Story
```
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

```

## Application Description
This is a react.js application that allows user to view and sort employees by name. If you click name it will sort the employees by name. The page is broken up into components, a searchbar, navbar, title, and table. The search bar is currently not functional however if you look in the console.log you will see that the filter is working but the table is not updating, I plan to resoilve this problem soon.


## Usage 
```
                                     
Use the live application via the githubpages link provided above
